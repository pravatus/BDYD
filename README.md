Club BDYD? source code. 
"but did you die?"

## Notes

### How to build?

1. Download and install dependencies (see [3rd Party Assets](BDYD_3rd_party_assets/README.md)
2. Build 

### Sanity check meshes after importing STL file into Blender

- Try merging double vertices (`M` > "Merge by Distance").  There should be zero (0) double vertices. 
- Look for any weird or unexpected geometry in X-Ray mode (`Alt+Z`). 

Found anything? -> fix mesh in OpenSCAD.
